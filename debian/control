Description: charset, encoding and language detection for Python (Documentation)
 charset-normalizer is a library for detection of charsets, encodings,
 and languages in Python programs. It can be compared to chardet, with
 a different approach, which intends to make it faster and more reliable.
 charset-normalizer can also detect natural languages.
 .
 All IANA character set names for which the Python core library provides
 codecs are supported.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
